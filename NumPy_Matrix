In Python we can implement matrix using
a) Nested Lists
b) Numpy Arrays
c) Matrix: Using a class called matrix in Numpy library.

Matrix Addition (+)
Multiplication  We use dot method. Array multiplication is diff than matrix multiplication. (a.dot(b))
Transpose of Matrix: numpy.transpose(a)  OR a.transpose


MATRIX CLASS:
numpy.matrix(data, dtype=None, Copy=True)

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARRAY AND MATRIX:
1. Matrix can be created using string notation.
2. Matrix objects are always 2D.
3. Can use * for MAtrix  multiplication.
4.
