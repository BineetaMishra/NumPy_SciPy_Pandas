Similarities Between Lists and NumPy Arrays:
1. Both are used for storing data.
2. Both are mutable.
3. Both can be indexed and iterrated through.
4. Both can be sliced. Slicing Operation is possible.


DIFFERENCES Between Lists and NumPy Arrays:
1. List can be used to store different datatypes, Arrays store same datatypes.
2. Do operations on Array but not on list. Like we can divide the array not the list.
3.To use Array we need to import Numpy libraries but List is Built-in, we do not need to install anything externally.

ADVANTAGES OF ARRAY OVER LISTS:
1. Consumes less memory
2.Fast.
3. Convenient to use when we do mathematical operations.
