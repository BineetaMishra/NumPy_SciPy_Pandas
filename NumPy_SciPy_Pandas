Similarities Between Lists and NumPy Arrays:
1. Both are used for storing data.
2. Both are mutable.
3. Both can be indexed and iterrated through.
4. Both can be sliced. Slicing Operation is possible.


DIFFERENCES Between Lists and NumPy Arrays:
1. List can be used to store different datatypes, Arrays store same datatypes.
2. Do operations on Array but not on list. Like we can divide the array not the list.
3.To use Array we need to import Numpy libraries but List is Built-in, we do not need to install anything externally.

ADVANTAGES OF ARRAY OVER LISTS:
1. Consumes less memory
2.Fast.
3. Convenient to use when we do mathematical operations.


ARRAYS:

There are different functions to create NumPy Arrays:
1. Array()
2. Arrange()
3. Zeros()
4. Ones()
5. Linspace()
6. Eye()
7. Random()



1. Array(): Very similar to Mathematical Array. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Arrange(): This is Array Range. This function returns evenly spaced  numeric values within an interval stored as NumPY array.
For syntax and example refer to the Jupyter Notebbok.


3. Zeros(): Creates  Array filled with zero. For syntax and example refer to the Jupyter Notebbok.

4. Ones(): Creates  Array filled with zero.

5. Linspace(): Creates sequence of evenly spaced values within a defined interval. It also gives values in the specified range. 
And the values are evenly spaces like the arrange function. For syntax and example refer to the Jupyter Notebbok.

6. Eye(): Returns the array where all the values is equal to 0, except fot the k-th diagonal, whose values are equal to 1. We can chose which diagonal can contain the vaue 1.
For syntax and example refer to the Jupyter Notebbok.
